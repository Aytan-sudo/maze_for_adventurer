# Maze for Adventurers

It is a small game coded in Scracth, which allows a hero to move in a maze to find the exit to the stairs. Once he reaches the last level, he can take the treasure.
Unfortunately, the minotaurs jealously protect the treasure...

The game is here : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/815680766/

- Move with the arrow keys
- Press "w" to walk stealthy
  - this can be used to dodge minotaurs (they have a small chance to detect you if you pass discreetly behind them).
  - It can also be used to position yourself finely to take a difficult turn.

There are four levels, the last one contains the treasure!
